# dtd-hosting

This repository is used to host `second.dtd` on GitHub Pages to demonstrate an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. The goal is to exploit the system to read the content from `https://internal.websec.cs.uni-paderborn.de/second`. Although this URL is not publicly accessible, it can be accessed from the `websec.cs.upb.de` website.
